Simple Utility to check ping and restart the router/modem if the ping is high above your desired range automatically until you get better ping. Made for my personal use, Very useful for situations where the ISP's routing is different for different IP ranges, This utlity can be used to automatically restart the modem, So each time you get a different IP range.

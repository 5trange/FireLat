# FireLat
Simple Utility to check ping to a server and restart the router/modem if the ping is bad or above your desired range automatically until you get better ping. I made this for my personal use, As my ISP uses different routing for each of their IP ranges. What this program does is check the latency to the given server and then restarts the connection until a better latency to target server is acheived. 
Works on Selenium, Can be tuned to suit your Modem/Browser needs. 

Python Packages necessary:

selenium
pythonping
requests
